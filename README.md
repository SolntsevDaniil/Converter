# Note #2
I have a lot of shitcode in this project cause it is the hardest thing that I have ever written from the point of my current knowledge level of JavaScript and designing, my current experience generally. With the increasing of my done projects and read books, my code will be more readable and shorter, scalable and understandable. And someday I will rewrite this Converter maybe with some improvements...
